## Features
#### Recover Deleted Messages:
The Recovery Wiz app captures and stores messages as soon as they arrive in your notification bar. Even if the sender deletes the message before you read it, our app will have stored the notification, allowing you to view the original content. This is perfect for apps like WhatsApp, where messages can be deleted by the sender.

#### Track Notifications from Any App: 
Our app works seamlessly with all the messaging apps you use on your phone, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, and more. As long as the app sends notifications, Recovery Wiz will capture and store them.

#### Privacy and Security: 
Your privacy is our top priority. Recovery Wiz does not collect any personal data, and all notifications are stored securely on your device. The app does not require internet access, ensuring that your stored messages and notifications remain private and are not shared with third parties. You can also set a passcode or use biometric security to protect access to your stored notifications.

#### View Missed Notifications: 
Sometimes notifications are dismissed accidentally, or they may disappear after being swiped away. With Recovery Wiz, you can recover and view all missed notifications in a single, organized list. Whether it's an important work message or a missed social media update, you can recover and read it at any time.

#### Filter by Time and App: 
Easily filter your stored notifications based on the time they were received or the app they originated from. This makes finding specific messages quick and effortless. Whether you’re looking for a specific WhatsApp conversation or a message from Instagram, our advanced filtering system has you covered.
